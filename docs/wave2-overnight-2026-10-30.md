# Wave 2 overnight maintenance — 2026-10-30 (executed 2026-11-02)

Status vocabulary: **Confirmed** (reproduced or read in code) · **Implemented** · **Tested** · **Suspected** · **Proposed**. Nothing here is "validated" in the model sense. Nothing was pushed or merged.

## 1. Starting state and safety checks

| Item | Observed |
|---|---|
| `/Users/arjunvedere/pivot-work` | **Not** a git repo. The repo is `pivot-work/pivot`, checked out on `feat/r8-canonical-data-foundation` (`5cada84`, one untracked `docs/r8.zip`). `e0b7363` is **not** its ancestor, so that checkout was left alone (audit-only per the brief). |
| Wave 2 worktree | `/Users/arjunvedere/pivot-maint-w2-worktree`, `maint/application-integrity-w2`, HEAD `664c4b297a5a`, `status --porcelain` empty, no stash, no lock files; `e0b7363` is an ancestor; 12 commits `e0b7363..664c4b2`. |
| Other worktrees | 11 total. Dirty (untouched): `pivot` (R8, 1 untracked), `pivot-r8-2-worktree` (1), `pivot-r9-1-worktree` (1). Live processes: uvicorn from the R8 checkout and `next dev -p 3093` from the R9.3A worktree (owner preview). Nothing but this session used the Wave 2 worktree. |
| Disk | ≈11 GiB free at the end (was 12). |
| Backup | Bundle of `664c4b2` exists (`~/pivot-backups/git/pivot-maint-application-integrity-w2-664c4b2-2026-10-22.bundle`, per W2.8). The branch is bundled separately (§13). |
| New branch | `maint/wave2-correctness-overnight` from `664c4b2`, in a **new worktree** `/Users/arjunvedere/pivot-wave2-overnight-worktree` (the existing Wave 2 worktree was not switched or modified). |

The brief's "last known state" (Oct 21) was stale: Wave 2 stages W2.1–W2.7 had already been implemented locally on Oct 21–22.

## 2. Audit of Issues A–E (at `664c4b2`)

| Issue | Status at `664c4b2` | Evidence | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** unsafe train/score instructions | **Fixed** by `345cd6d` | No `make train`/`make score` text remains in `backend/app`, `frontend/app|components|lib` (`git grep`). README line 111 and 165–175 frame them as disposable-DB/destructive. | In-app hints still say `make seed-config` (`cba/builder.py:31`, `ingestion/quality.py:320`), `make sync-data`, `make refresh`. These are not training/scoring; `sync-data` is a network call. Low; owner decision (also noted in `W2_CLOSEOUT_REVIEW.md` §7). |
| **B** trade validation-before-commit | **Fixed** for `POST /trades` by `54ec97f` (`flush` not `commit`; 11 tests in `test_trade_create_atomicity.py`) | `trades.py:create_trade` | **Two siblings were not covered — see §3.** |
| **C** cap-parameter season | **Fixed** by `f2410e6` for the quality check. All other cap lookups already key on `settings.cap_league_year`; no request-level season parameter exists, so "requested season" is the configured cap year. `cap_params_row` returns `None` for a missing year with no fallback. | `git grep LeagueCapParameters`, `cba/resolver.py:83` | The cap year is a config value (`CAP_LEAGUE_YEAR`, default `2026-27`); it does not roll over automatically. Not a defect, but a pinned-default risk. |
| **D** evaluator integrity | **Fixed** by `dae97c9` (response schemas) and `f5f2ee0`…`664c4b2` (stale-state hook, reveal ownership, rules-check failure notice). 646 frontend tests passed at the tip per `W2_9_VERIFICATION_HANDOFF.md` (not re-run by me). | Handoffs | Page never mounted in a browser. Saved-trade responses validated only by `tradeDetailSchema`. `adopt()` has no caller. Deferred by the owner. |
| **E** TEI "VALIDATED" | **Fixed** by `594d8fa` (`Confidence.HEURISTIC`). Formula untouched. README and `docs/limitations.md` already say "interpretable heuristic". | `services/intelligence.py`, README line 72 | `main` and the R-lineage branches still carry `VALIDATED` until this lands. `docs/resume-bullets.md:48` says "validated impact modeling" (a doc, not product UI). |

## 3. New defects found and fixed

### Fix 1 — `a77c7b5` `fix(comparisons): validate before committing a comparison`
- **Confirmed (red run `red1`).** `POST /comparisons` committed the `ComparisonSet` before `get_comparison` evaluated the trades. If that raised (cap parameters gone → 409), the comparison stayed. Also, an unknown `scenario_id` returned **201**, was stored, and was silently replaced by default "custom" weights on read.
- **Change:** `backend/app/api/v1/comparisons.py` — unknown scenario → 404 `scenario <id> not found` (same wording as the trade endpoints); `flush` instead of `commit`; build the response; one `commit` after.
- **Tests:** `backend/tests/integration/test_comparison_create_atomicity.py` (4): valid create persists and reads back identically; unknown scenario → 404 and no row; unknown trade → 404 and no row (control, passed before too); evaluation rejected (cap rows deleted) → 409 and no row.
- **Severity:** medium. **Confidence:** high.

### Fix 2 — `5ec78ce` `fix(scenarios): reject an unknown focal team before saving the scenario`
- **Confirmed (probe + red run).** `POST /scenarios` with an unknown `focal_team_id` returned **500** after committing 1 scenario and 6 weight rows; `GET /scenarios` then returned **500** for every later request (`_scenario_out` reads `focal_team.abbreviation`). On SQLite (which does not enforce FKs here) this corrupts the list endpoint. PostgreSQL would raise an FK error instead; not exercised.
- **Change:** `backend/app/api/v1/scenarios.py` — 404 `team <id> not found` before anything is added.
- **Tests:** `backend/tests/integration/test_scenario_create_validation.py` (2): unknown team → 404, no scenario/weight rows, later `GET /scenarios` still 200; valid scenario creates, lists and reports its weights.
- **Severity:** medium-high for a dev SQLite database. **Confidence:** high.

A third fix was not made: the remaining candidates (saved-evaluation validation, `adopt()` cleanup, `make seed-config` wording) are owner-deferred product or wording decisions, not demonstrated correctness defects.

## 4. Tests executed

All backend runs went through a guarded launcher (`env -i`, in-memory `DATABASE_URL`, `python -I -B`, imports asserted to resolve inside the new worktree, per-test file-backed SQLite under pytest `tmp_path`). The launcher and logs live in the session scratchpad (non-durable): `…/scratchpad/w2o/`.

| Run | Result |
|---|---|
| `test_trade_create_atomicity.py` (baseline, harness check) | 11 passed |
| New comparison tests, **before fix** (`red1`) | 3 failed, 1 passed — two real defects, one my own wrong response key (corrected) |
| New scenario tests, **before fix** (`red2`) | 1 failed (500), 1 passed |
| Comparison + scenario + trade-atomicity + `test_api.py` after fixes (`green3`) | **38 passed** |
| `test_api.py` + `test_fixture_isolation.py` | 27 passed |
| `ruff check`, `ruff format --check` on the four touched files; `mypy app/api/v1/comparisons.py` | clean |
| Full `tests/integration`, new branch, mis-pinned launcher (`integ2`) | 148 passed, 14 skipped, 4 failed (launcher artefact, below) |
| Full `tests/integration`, unmodified tip `664c4b2`, mis-pinned launcher (`integ_tip`, read-only run) | 142 passed, 14 skipped, the same 4 failed |
| Full `tests/integration`, new branch, corrected launcher (`integ3`) | **152 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed** |

**The 4 failures were caused by my test launcher, not by the code.** The launcher (copied from the W2.3-era one) pinned `ROSTER_SEASON=2025-26`. The rollover tests (`test_r8_cross_tool_consistency.py::TestToolsStayConsistentAcrossTheSeasonRollover`, three tests) and `test_r93a_round4_regressions.py::test_an_older_schema_does_not_turn_cap_outlook_into_a_500` expect the default, where the roster season follows the league year (`2026-27` since 1 July 2026; `config/__init__.py:224`). With the pin removed (`CURRENT_SEASON=2025-26`, `CAP_LEAGUE_YEAR=2026-27`, no `ROSTER_SEASON`): the 40 tests in those two files pass at the unmodified tip `664c4b2`, and the full `tests/integration` directory on this branch gives **152 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed** (`integ3`). It is not date-dependent. The earlier 148/4 and 142/4 figures above came from the mis-pinned launcher.

## 5. Not executed, and why
- Frontend: see §13 (run on 2026-11-02). `next build` and ESLint over the whole project were not run (§13).
- `next build`, browser or preview smoke tests: the only running previews serve owner data; no isolated preview was available.
- PostgreSQL tests (`test_postgres_compat.py`): require a test DB URL that was deliberately unset.
- CI-equivalent run (coverage threshold, Alembic check, Playwright e2e, docker): not run locally.
- No training, scoring, ingestion, GOAT/BALLDONTLIE/NBA calls, or database access outside `tmp_path` SQLite files.

## 6. Behaviour and compatibility
- `POST /comparisons` with a non-existent `scenario_id`: **201 → 404** (`not_found`). Previously stored a dangling reference and used default weights silently.
- `POST /comparisons` whose trades cannot be evaluated: now returns the same error as before but **no longer leaves a row**.
- `POST /scenarios` with an unknown team: **500 → 404** (`not_found`), nothing stored.
- Valid requests, response shapes and all numerics are unchanged. No analytical output changed.
- Existing databases may already contain a scenario with a dangling `focal_team_id` created by the old bug; the fix does not repair it (and I did not touch any real database). `GET /scenarios` would still 500 on such a database.

## 7. Local commits (branch `maint/wave2-correctness-overnight`, parent `664c4b2`)
- `a77c7b5` fix(comparisons): validate before committing a comparison
- `5ec78ce` fix(scenarios): reject an unknown focal team before saving the scenario
- (this report, committed separately)

## 8. Known issues remaining
- Deferred (owner): saved-trade/saved-evaluation response validation and whether `?load=` should load stored evaluations; `adopt()` removal; `make seed-config`/`sync-data` hints in app messages.
- Not verified in a real browser: the evaluator page, failure notice and reveal behaviour.
- `docs/resume-bullets.md` uses "validated impact modeling".
- Legacy `fillna(0.0)` in `analytics/impact.py` and `analytics/features.py` (flagged in CLAUDE.md; reported, not changed).
- Wave 2 is **not** declared complete: the evaluator page was never mounted in a browser, no `next build`, nothing published.

## 9. Thesis data-readiness (read-only; no model built)

**Verified capabilities** are from code and docs; I did not query any database.

1. **Lineup/stint observations: no.** `docs/limitations.md` ("Lineup-aware fit is deferred, on measurement") records that `LeagueDashLineups` returns real groups but five-man samples are noise (median 20 min; implied sd ≈ 16 per 100). `make lineup-availability` reads sample sizes and stores nothing. There is no stint table.
2. **Ten players on court: no.** BALLDONTLIE/GOAT `/lineups` returns **starting fives, not combinations** (`docs/r8-1/balldontlie-trial-readiness.md`, `docs/r8-3/data-coverage-matrix.md`; observed on 2 games). `/plays` was sampled on 1 game (~595 plays) and substitutions-to-stints reconstruction has not been attempted or verified.
3. **Possessions and margin:** game scores exist (`games.home_score/away_score` via `ingestion/jobs.py:sync_games`, NBA.com `LeagueGameLog`). Possession counts could be constructed from box-score totals, but no per-stint possessions exist. `PlayerGameStats` is a schema only; nothing writes it (`git grep`).
4. **Coverage:** season-level player/team stats over about ten seasons; completed-trade corpus 2016-17…2025-26. Game-level history exists only as the Kaggle `nbadb`, whose play-by-play **ends 2023-06-12**, before the seasons Pivot models. GOAT history samples reach back to 1995 per the executive report but are sampled, not ingested.
5. **Risks:** season alignment across separate roster/stats/contract clocks (CLAUDE.md §4); the rollover checkpoint 2026-11-03; present-state fields (`is_active`, position) leaking into history; box-score-only data cannot support adjusted plus-minus; five-man noise; the circularity R4-2 withdrew a claim over.
6. **Reproducible without uncontrolled API use:** partly. The BALLDONTLIE adapter caches under `data/imports/` and has an evaluation plan (13 probes), but lineups/plays/advanced endpoints are GOAT-restricted and metered. No retained play-by-play corpus exists locally.
7. **To build clean train/validation/test sets:** a game-level event or substitution source covering the target seasons, a stint constructor with an audit (ten players, period/clock continuity, score deltas reconcile to final scores), a possession definition, and season-forward splits using the existing as-of discipline.
8. **Reusable safely:** `modeling/panel.py` (`AsOfPanel`, `LeakageError`), `modeling/backtest.py` rolling-origin folds and the leakage audit, `modeling/registry.py` and `contract.py` (candidate ≠ validated), the preregistered holdout protocol (`docs/r9-1/`), `modeling/metrics.py`/`intervals.py`. Not reusable as a starting point: the retired player-level ridge in `analytics/impact.py` (documented as a volume metric with no team-level validity).
9. **Smallest next data-readiness task:** a read-only feasibility audit of one stint source for **one past season**: fetch (or locate, within an approved request budget) play-by-play with substitutions for ~20 games, build stints offline in a scratch directory, and report the fraction whose ten-player set and score delta reconcile to the box score. This answers #2 and #3 empirically before any data is ingested.
10. **Owner decisions before coding:** possession definition and weighting; handling of garbage time, overtime, and end-of-period stints; how to treat players with few possessions (penalty scaling, minimum exposure); season boundaries and whether multi-season pooling or priors are allowed; target (margin per 100 possessions vs per possession); how a one-player substitution difference is defined and what uncertainty is reported; the held-out period and whether the existing holdout ledger applies; permitted data sources and API budget; licensing of NBA.com-derived aggregates (already flagged open).

## 10. Recommended next engineering task
The full backend/frontend runs are done (§13). Next, with the owner's authorisation, run CI on the branch and perform a browser smoke test of Strategy Lab and the Trade Evaluator on a preview built from this branch over a throwaway data copy. If the owner wants one further correctness change, add a read-time guard so `GET /scenarios` tolerates (or the app reports) a pre-existing dangling-team scenario.

## 11. Items needing owner approval
- Pushing/merging the Wave 2 branch (and this one).
- Whether to reword the remaining `make seed-config` / `make sync-data` in-app hints.
- Checking or repairing any existing real database for scenarios with unknown `focal_team_id` (this session touched no real database).
- The thesis decisions in §9.10 and any API-budget use for the stint feasibility audit.

## 12. How to verify before merging
```bash
cd /Users/arjunvedere/pivot-wave2-overnight-worktree
git log --oneline 664c4b2..HEAD
git diff 664c4b2..HEAD --stat
git diff 664c4b2..HEAD -- backend/app
```
Then run the three new/related test modules against a disposable in-memory config (not an application database): `tests/integration/test_comparison_create_atomicity.py`, `test_scenario_create_validation.py`, `test_trade_create_atomicity.py`.

## 13. Final verification and preservation pass (2026-11-02)

Branch `maint/wave2-correctness-overnight`, HEAD at the start of the pass `32d022d07d90dba3ddbea3ef0869363669353335`, working tree clean, 12 GiB free before and after. Other worktrees were only read (`git status`); their HEADs and dirty counts were unchanged (R8 `pivot` 1, `r8-2` 1, `r9-1` 1 untracked/dirty lines, all pre-existing). This pass changed only this document.

### Backup
- File: `~/pivot-backups/git/pivot-maint-wave2-correctness-overnight-32d022d-2026-11-02.bundle`, 13,550,224 bytes, mode 0400. Created with `git bundle create … maint/wave2-correctness-overnight`; the name did not exist beforehand and no existing backup was written to.
- SHA-256 `decead3b355de82064e298652fdce81d339e020ed643b660bc3186097d21b420`, recorded in the new file `SHA256SUMS-maint-wave2-overnight-32d022d.txt` (`shasum -a 256 -c` → OK). The existing `SHA256SUMS-*.txt` files were not edited.
- `git bundle verify`: "The bundle records a complete history." `list-heads`: `32d022d… refs/heads/maint/wave2-correctness-overnight`.
- Coverage: a bare scratch clone of the bundle reports `a77c7b5`, `5ec78ce`, `9d1fd2c`, `32d022d` and the base `664c4b2` all as commits; the branch ref resolves to `32d022d`; `git fsck` reported no errors. The older `…w2-664c4b2-2026-10-22.bundle` still checks OK against its own checksum file.
- Limits: same volume as the repository, not off-device. This document's own edit from this pass is committed after the bundle and is therefore not in it; refresh the bundle if it matters.

### Backend (guarded launcher: `env -i`, in-memory `DATABASE_URL`, `CURRENT_SEASON=2025-26`, `CAP_LEAGUE_YEAR=2026-27`, **no** `ROSTER_SEASON`, `python -I -B`, module paths asserted inside this worktree, `-p no:cacheprovider`, basetemp in scratch)
| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| `tests/unit` (whole directory) | **3200 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed**, 1 warning (LangSmith beta-parameter notice), 379 s |
| `tests/integration` (whole directory, run earlier, `integ3`) | **152 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed** |
Commands, run from `backend/`: `pytest -c pyproject.toml tests/unit -q -p no:randomly` and the same for `tests/integration`, through the launcher.

### Frontend (read-only dependencies from `pivot-r8-2-worktree/frontend/node_modules`; `package-lock.json` byte-identical to this worktree's; no frontend file differs from `664c4b2`)
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Full Vitest, unfiltered (jsdom, default-deny `fetch` guard, one worker, `env -i`) | **35 files, 646 tests passed**, exit 0 (same counts as `W2_9_VERIFICATION_HANDOFF.md` at the tip) |
| Whole-project `tsc --noEmit` | **exit 0, 0 diagnostics**; the program lists 181 files under `frontend/`, equal to the 181 tracked `.ts`/`.tsx` files |
| `next build` | **Not run (blocked).** The worktree has no `node_modules`, a build writes `.next/` and may fetch fonts over the network; borrowing another worktree's dependencies for a build is not safe here. |
| ESLint over the whole project | Not run (not needed for a zero-frontend-diff change). |

### The skipped tests
- **14 integration skips: all in `tests/integration/test_postgres_compat.py`**, a module-level `skipif` on `PIVOT_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` (unset by design: it would create and drop a database on a PostgreSQL server). It covers the Alembic chain, season-type constraints, ingestion idempotence and roster-history reads on PostgreSQL. **Expected skips, but a real gap:** nothing exercises PostgreSQL for the migration head or canonical layer in this pass, and no PostgreSQL test covers trades, scenarios or comparisons. The two fixes do their checks in application code before inserting, so they do not rely on SQLite's missing foreign-key enforcement; that is reasoning, not a PostgreSQL run.
- **5 unit skips:** three live-Ollama tests (`test_assistant_live_ollama.py` ×2, `test_assistant_retrieval.py:734`), one needing a local RealGM snapshot (`test_draft_pick_ownership.py:132`, `data/imports/` is gitignored), one needing a registered `tei_to_net_rating` model in the database (`test_impact_units.py:289`). All depend on external services or owner data; expected.

### Review of the two implementation commits
- **Scope:** `git diff 664c4b2 HEAD --name-only` lists four code/test files plus this document. `comparisons.py` +8/−2 and `scenarios.py` +3/−1; no model, formula, schema, migration, dependency or frontend change.
- **`a77c7b5`:** the scenario check comes after the existing trade check, so the error precedence for already-failing requests is unchanged. `flush` assigns the primary key by Python-side default, so `get_comparison(comparison.id, db)` reads the staged row from the session. `get_comparison` and the `_trade_detail` it calls (with `persist_results=False`) contain no commit, so nothing persists until the single `commit`. If either raises, `get_db`'s `finally: db.close()` discards the transaction; this is demonstrated by the separate-engine test. A falsy `scenario_id` (`null`, as Strategy Lab sends) skips the check as before. Consumer `frontend/app/strategy-lab/page.tsx:204` shows `err.message` in a toast, so the new 404 is surfaced. The response dict is built before the commit; the session uses `expire_on_commit=False`, and the returned value is a plain dict, so no post-commit refresh is needed.
- **`5ec78ce`:** the check runs before any `add`, so the failure path writes nothing; `ScenarioPatch` cannot change the focal team, so no other path creates the same state. The only frontend caller (`team-outlook/[teamId]/page.tsx:128`) sends the route's team id.
- **Coverage:** 4 + 2 tests, each failing-then-passing where a defect exists (red runs `red1`, `red2`), plus controls (unknown trade; valid creation read back identical; valid scenario listed). Not covered: a scenario with `focal_team_id` that exists but is a different season's team (no such concept in the model); PostgreSQL (above).
- **Analytical integrity:** no scoring, weights or evaluation logic changed. The only behavioural change is a rejection (404) in place of silently substituting default weights for an unknown scenario.
- **Findings:** none requiring change.

### Browser smoke test
**Skipped, blocked.** No preview of this branch exists. The listening services are the owner's development backend on `127.0.0.1:8010` (a `uvicorn` from the R8 checkout) and the R9.3A preview on 8093/3093, which runs different code over a data copy. Both are active, and both smoke workflows (creating a scenario, creating a comparison) write rows, so using them would modify active preview data. Starting a preview of this branch would need a data copy and frontend dependencies in this worktree; not done.

### Outstanding Wave 2 work (unchanged by this pass)
- Evaluator page never mounted in a browser; no `next build`; no PostgreSQL run.
- Deferred by the owner: saved-trade/saved-evaluation response validation and the `?load=` product question; `adopt()` removal; wording of `make seed-config` / `make sync-data` hints in app messages.
- Existing databases may contain scenarios with unknown `focal_team_id` from before the fix; they would still break `GET /scenarios` (not checked, not repaired).
- `main` and the R8–R9 branches still carry TEI `VALIDATED`; the correction lives only in the unpublished Wave 2 chain.
- Nothing from Wave 1 or Wave 2 is pushed or merged, no CI has run on this branch, and the backups are on one volume.

**Assessment: Ready for owner review.** The scoped changes are preserved, independently tested, and show no failures; the gaps above are verification limits, not known defects. Wave 2 is not complete.
