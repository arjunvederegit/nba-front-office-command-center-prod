 * for exactly that result is committed (`displayed` is the request's own result object, and the
 * section element has been handed to `sectionRef`), an effect starts the delay, so it is measured
 * from the section being there and never from the request completing. When it fires it asks the
 * request whether it still owns the evaluation (no newer evaluation has started, the context is the
 * committed one, the page is mounted) and that the element it captured is still in the document,
 * and scrolls THAT element, never an element looked up by id. The effect's cleanup cancels the timer
 * when the result changes, goes away, or the page unmounts; the check at execution does not depend on
 * that cleanup having run.
 *
 * Re-renders that change none of `pending`, `section` or `displayed` (a team selection, validation)
 * do not re-run the effect, so they neither restart the delay nor schedule a second reveal.
