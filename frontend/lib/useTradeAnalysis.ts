/**
 * The Trade Evaluator's two asynchronous results — the evaluation and the live rules check — and
 * the pending state of each, kept so that a response can only land on the screen state it was
 * requested for.
 *
 * Three ideas, kept apart:
 *
 * - INPUT CONTEXT. Each channel remembers the request its data and pending work belong to (`sig`,
 *   a JSON copy of the request fields, so a re-render that rebuilds equal arrays is the same
 *   context) and the saved-trade identity (`key`). When either differs from what the page now
 *   passes, the channel moves to a new `epoch` with nothing in it. That happens in the render that
 *   carries the new inputs (React discards that pass and re-renders before anything is committed),
 *   so no committed render ever pairs the new inputs with the old analysis. Because the epoch only
 *   moves forward, returning to earlier inputs (A, B, A) is a new context and revives nothing.
 * - REQUEST OWNERSHIP. Within an epoch, each request gets an id. Only the epoch's newest request
 *   may publish, report an error, or clear `pending`; an older one is ignored whatever it returns.
 *   The evaluation and the rules check are separate channels, so neither invalidates the other.
 * - ADOPTION. `adopt` installs an authoritative result for a stated request in a fresh epoch, which
 *   supersedes anything already in flight even for identical inputs. Passing a different `draftKey`
 *   (a saved trade replacing the draft) does the same for both channels.
 *
 * Nothing is cancelled: obsolete requests run to completion and are then ignored.
