/**
 * Player headshot resolution — the one place that knows where a portrait can come from.
 *
 * Two sources, tried in order:
 *  1. `official` — the NBA's own CDN, keyed by the canonical NBA player id (`players.nba_player_id`;
 *     Pivot's internal player ids are UUIDs and are never used here).
 *  2. `local` — the user-supplied photo dataset served by the backend asset route
 *     (`/api/v1/assets/players/{id}`), which is what Pivot has always shown.
 * When neither has a usable image the caller draws its neutral silhouette.
 *
 * RIGHTS: a public CDN URL is not a licence to redistribute NBA photographs. The official source is
 * therefore development-only (`officialHeadshotsEnabled`) and compiles to "off" in a production
 * build, which leaves the local source — Pivot's existing public behaviour — exactly as it was.
 *
 * Swapping the preferred provider later means editing `OFFICIAL_PROVIDER` below; no consumer
 * passes a URL, so none of them changes.
