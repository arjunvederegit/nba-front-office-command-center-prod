 * - **verified** — every rostered player is priced. A plain number.
 * - **floor** — some are not. The number is the sum of the contracts on file, which can
 *   only be *below* the real payroll, so it is prefixed `≥` and carries its coverage.
 *   It is never presented as the payroll and never has a missing salary imputed into it.
 * - **unavailable** — nothing on file. A dash.

 * `note` is not optional decoration: a floor rendered without it is a wrong number.
