    do not have, so the true payroll is `known + (something ≥ 0)`. Nothing is imputed,
    and no missing salary is replaced by a minimum, a median or a league average.

    The asymmetry this buys is the whole point. A lower bound can *refute* — a team whose
    known salaries alone clear the second apron is above the second apron whatever the
    missing rows say — but it can never *verify*, because the unknown remainder can
    always push a team over a line it currently sits under. Rules therefore read
