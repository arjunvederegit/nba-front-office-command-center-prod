"""Roster size limits around a trade.

NBA.com roster snapshots include two-way players (up to 18 rows: 15 standard + 3
two-way), and two-way status is only knowable with contract data. The rule therefore
uses precise standard-contract counts when contract types are available and honest
wider bounds (fail only above the 18-spot ceiling) when they are not, saying so."""
