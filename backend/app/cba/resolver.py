"""Request-scoped batching for the salary lookups behind every trade evaluation.

Measured on the live database with `contracts` at **0 rows** — the cheapest possible
case, because a missing contract is one query that returns nothing:

    POST /trades/evaluate  (2-for-2)        61 queries
    POST /trades/generate  (focal BOS)   21,326 queries in 2.15 s

of which 16,640 were the same `SELECT … FROM contracts WHERE player_id = ?` and 1,169
were `SELECT … FROM league_cap_parameters` for one immutable row. With contract data
loaded the plan measured 47,158 queries / 5.17 s on local SQLite; on the compose
Postgres path that is 7–14 s of pure round-trip latency.

The cache lives in `Session.info`, so its lifetime is exactly the request's session —
`get_db` creates one per request — and it is **cleared on every flush and commit**, so a
write inside a session can never be served a stale read. Nothing here is global.
