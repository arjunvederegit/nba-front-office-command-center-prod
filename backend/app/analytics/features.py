# R4-2. The defensive composites. **Committed before any named-player check was run**,
# which is the anti-overfitting requirement (A'''): no player's value selected these
# weights, and the face-validity review that follows is reported, never gated.
#
# The plan prescribed the team-demeaned on-court differential as the PRIMARY term at
# >= 50 % weight, with event rates minor. The data contradicts that, and the criteria the
# plan proposed to justify it turn out not to test the release:
#
#   - A placebo that ignores the player entirely — score everyone by their own team's
#     defensive rating — scores rho -0.988 on the plan's A', a decile gap of 11.01 on A''
#     (threshold 3.0) and R2 0.904 on the supporting change-on-change design. A criterion
#     a zero-information metric wins by 2.6x cannot discriminate.
#   - A' is additionally degenerate by construction for a demeaned quantity: each
#     possession is charged to five on-court players, so the possession-weighted mean of
#     on-court DEF_RATING over a full roster IS the team rating, and aggregation destroys
#     94.7 % of the dispersion (player sd 8.66 -> team aggregate 0.455).
#   - On the non-circular test — does the metric add anything beyond the persistence of
#     the differential itself — the differential adds nothing (partial r -0.056) while the
#     event rates add the most (+0.133). Out-of-sample gain against a team's own prior
#     defensive rating falls monotonically as the impact weight rises: +0.0253 at weight
#     0.00, +0.0093 at 0.30, -0.0089 at 0.60.
#   - Reliability decides the rest. Year-over-year, the shipped composite is 0.859
#     (0.869 for players who changed team); the plan's 0.60-impact blend is 0.44 and 0.37.
#     A trade tool projects a player onto a new roster, so a metric that does not survive
#     the move is not fit for the one thing it is for.
#
# The differential is kept as a 0.10 minority term rather than dropped, because it is the
# only term carrying any signal on the question the product actually asks: for the 100
# players who changed team, prior-season defensive value against the change in the
# RECEIVING team's defensive rating gives -0.151 for the differential and +0.001 for
# steals. That correlation is not distinguishable from zero at this sample size, and is
# reported as such — it is a reason to keep a minority term, not a claim of validation.
#
# WHAT SELECTED THESE TERMS, and what did not.
#
# **The weights are chosen by construct, not by the numbers above.** Adversarial checking
# established that the criteria cannot tell a defensive statistic from an offensive one:
# holding this vector fixed and swapping only the 0.22 term for `TS_PCT` — true-shooting
# percentage, which has no defensive content whatsoever — BEATS `DREB_PCT` on every
# non-circular criterion:
#
#     criterion                     DREB_PCT      TS_PCT
#     A' (team aggregate)             -0.499      -0.542
#     A'' (decile gap)                  4.50        5.23
#     lagged team fit, rho            -0.309      -0.377
#     ...partial t                     -1.84       -2.58
#     ...leave-one-team-out gain      +0.013      +0.054
#
# A criterion that prefers an offensive statistic in a defensive slot is measuring "good
# player on a good team", not defence. So the numbers reported above are evidence that
# this composite is not WORSE than the steals proxy on the things anyone has been able to
# measure; they are not evidence that the weights are right.
#
# Every term here is included because it is a defensive act: a block, a steal, ending the
# opponent's possession with a rebound, the cost of fouling, and the points the opponent
# scored while the player was on the floor. `TS_PCT` is excluded despite scoring better,
# which is what construct validity is for.
#
# What is NOT claimed: none of this validates the composite as a measure of defensive
# ability. Every target available in this repository is derived from on-court DEF_RATING,
# so every test is circular to some degree. Honest validation needs the matchup and
# tracking data that R6 defers, and `docs/limitations.md` says so.
#
# Known and disclosed rather than fixed: blocks and defensive rebounding carry 0.58 of the
# weight, so the composite is big-biased; and its `DREB_PCT` term correlates 0.907 with
# the input of the separate `rebounding` skill, giving a 0.579 overlap between the two
# skills. Dropping `DREB_PCT` would cut that overlap to 0.280 — but the only evidence that
# dropping it costs anything comes from the criteria just shown to be unable to
# discriminate, so there is no measured basis for either choice. It stays because ending a
# defensive possession is a defensive act, and the overlap is stated instead.
