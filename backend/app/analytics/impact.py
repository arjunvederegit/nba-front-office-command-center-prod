"""TradeLab Estimated Impact (TEI).

TEI is this project's own portfolio-model estimate of per-100-possession player impact.
It is NOT RAPTOR, EPM, LEBRON, BPM, or any proprietary metric, and it is documented as
an estimate with uncertainty (see docs/model-card-player-impact.md).

**The transparent weighted z-score index is the production metric (R3-1).** A ridge
challenger was trained and served until R3-1 on the strength of a held-out MAE of 0.637
against 0.645 for the index — a comparison on a *player-level next-season proxy*, which
is not the question the product asks of it. Measured at the level it is actually used,
team impact, the ridge has no validity at all:

    net_rating ~ team TEI (90 team-seasons)   index R2 = 0.7505   ridge R2 = 0.0039
    change-on-change (60 transitions)         index R2 = 0.6236   ridge R2 = 0.0030

The ridge is also a volume metric rather than an impact one, and — decisively for R3-2 —
it is not computable per season from stored artifacts, so a conversion coefficient could
only ever be fitted on n = 30 of a metric carrying no signal. It is retired, not
demoted: nothing in the serving path can select it.

Validation is still time-aware (no row-level random splits across seasons; transitions
only ever predict forward) and still reports the index against a persistence baseline,
because "better than assuming last season repeats" remains a claim worth checking."""
