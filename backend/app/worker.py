"""Background scheduler for containerized deployments (`docker compose up`).

Plain APScheduler over the same idempotent jobs the CLI runs — a deliberate,
documented simplification over Celery/RQ (see docs/decision-log.md): jobs are
CPU-light I/O batches on a small schedule, and every job is safe to re-run.
Schedules are configurable via environment variables."""
