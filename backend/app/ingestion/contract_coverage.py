"""What a contract snapshot actually covers, measured from the **roster** side.

The metric that matters is not the one the import naturally reports. A BBRef-side match
rate answers "how many rows in the file did we recognise", and can read 98 % while the
question the product needs answered — "can we compute payroll for this team" — is 60 %.

Payroll used to be all-or-nothing, which made coverage a cliff rather than a slope.
Measured sensitivity on the live 530-row roster:

    roster players missing a 2026-27 salary → teams with a payroll
     1 %  → 26/30      2 %  → 21/30      5 %  → 10/30
    10 %  →  4/30     20 %  →  0/30

An offseason snapshot plausibly misses 25–40 % (expired contracts) → **zero teams with
payroll**, while a BBRef-side match rate reports success the whole time.

R2c split that single number in two, and both are reported here because they answer
different questions:

- `teams_with_complete_payroll` — teams whose payroll may be **compared to a threshold**.
  Still all-or-nothing, still the gate every salary rule reads. Measured 0/30 against the
  Basketball-Reference offseason snapshot.
- `teams_with_disclosable_payroll` — teams for which a payroll figure can be **shown**
  with its coverage attached, as a lower bound. Measured 30/30 against the same snapshot.

An operator judging an import needs both: the second says the data is worth loading, the
first says whether legality can be verified from it. This module runs whether or not a
provider is configured.
