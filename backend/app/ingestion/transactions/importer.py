"""Import parsed Basketball-Reference trades into the local database.

## What this refuses to do

**No fuzzy matching.** A printed name becomes a player through the same tiered index the
contract import uses — exact, unaccented, suffix-insensitive — and a name that lands on
two players is recorded as `ambiguous`, not resolved by picking. The tie-break population
is the players who recorded a season in the trade's **own** season, not the current roster:
a 2016-17 trade is not about whoever holds that name today.

**No back-filled franchises.** Basketball-Reference prints `BRK`, `CHO` and `PHO` where
this database holds `BKN`, `CHA` and `PHX`. Those three are an explicit alias table, not a
prefix match; an abbreviation outside it is reported unresolved rather than guessed at.

**No invented certainty about picks.** A pick's conveyance class comes from the source's
own note, and where a trade moved two picks of the same year and round the note is attached
to both with `note_binding_ambiguous` set.

## Idempotence

`source_record_id` is `season:date:sha1(source_text)`, so re-importing the same snapshot
produces the same rows. The import replaces every row from this provider rather than
merging, because a corrected upstream page should not leave the old sentence behind.
