"""One place that turns a stored `source_provider` key into the upstream a reader sees.

This lives in `core` rather than beside the API schemas because both the serving layer
and the services that build source cards and decision memos need it, and a service must
not import from `app.api`.

The rule the whole module exists to enforce: **never name a source that was not read off
the row.** Before this, `Provenance` defaulted to `nba_api` / `NBA.com` and no caller ever
overrode it, so a synthetic demo row — correctly stamped `demo_seed` in storage, correctly
refused entry to a real database, correctly guarded by a Playwright roster-name check —
was still *described to the client as NBA.com data*. Four guards stopped synthetic data
leaking; none stopped it being mislabelled.
