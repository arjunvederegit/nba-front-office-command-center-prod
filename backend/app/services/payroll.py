"""Team payroll summaries under the R2c disclosed-coverage model.

Before R2c this returned `payroll: None` whenever a single rostered player was unpriced,
which was right about verdicts and wrong about disclosure — measured against the
Basketball-Reference offseason snapshot it made **0 of 30** teams report a payroll while
74 % of rostered players had a salary on file.

The summary now carries three separate things, and they are never merged:

- `payroll_known` — the sum of the contracts actually on file. A **lower bound**: every
  missing salary is a non-negative amount, so the real payroll is this number plus the
  unpriced remainder. Nothing is imputed.
- `payroll_coverage` — how many of how many, and what is missing, so the number is never
  rendered bare.
- `payroll` / `payroll_available` — unchanged. Still `None` unless every rostered player
  is priced. This is the only figure a caller may compare against a cap threshold, and
  it is what keeps an incomplete roster from producing a verified cap position.
