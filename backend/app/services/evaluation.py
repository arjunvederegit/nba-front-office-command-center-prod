        The measured defect this replaces: `assets` counted picks (8 points each,
        regardless of which pick) and read payroll from `team_legality.payroll_before`,
        which is `None` unless *every* rostered player is priced — 0 of 30 teams under the
        available contract data. Over 482 scored evaluations it therefore took only three
        values, {48, 50, 52}, from the roster-spot term alone, and contributed **−0.006**
        of composite variance while holding 15 % of the weight. A component that cannot
        move is not a conservative component; it is a placebo diluting the ones that can.

        Picks are now valued by the empirical curve (`analytics.picks`) rather than
        counted, so a 2027 unprotected first is no longer interchangeable with a 2031
        second, and a pick the curve refuses to price — protected, swapped, or of
        unverified ownership — is **not** midpointed into the score. It is listed with the
        range it would have spanned, because averaging over conditions nothing here can
        price is exactly how a conditional pick acquires a false decimal.

        **Payroll change is reported and not scored, and that was a measurement, not a
        preference.** A first pass computed the delta from the moved players' own salaries
        — which is exact whenever those players are priced, a far weaker requirement than
        pricing two rosters — and scored it here. Measured over the resulting 168
        fully-scored evaluations, `assets` then correlated **0.837** with `contract`
        (0.779 Spearman), because with no pick moving both components reduce to the same
        salary delta. Removing one double count and introducing another is not progress.
        `contract` divides salary by impact, which is the question it asks; this component
        is draft capital, which is a different asset class. The delta stays in the detail
        because it is genuinely useful; it is simply not scored twice.

        The consequence, stated plainly: **on a player-only trade this component is
        withheld**, and the composite renormalises without it. That is the honest answer.
        Without pick data there is no measurable asset content in a player-only deal that
        `contract` does not already price.

        Until R5 the dominant term was `prob_positive`, the Monte Carlo's probability that
        Δwins > 0. That is the performance component restated as a probability, and the
        composite counted it twice. Measured over 482 scored evaluations of the post-R4
        engine on the 30 ingested rosters:

            corr(prob_positive, performance)   0.913
            corr(risk, performance)            0.851  Pearson / 0.937 Spearman
            risk's share of composite variance 0.244

        So a quarter of the composite's variance came from a component that was 85–94 %
        the same quantity as another one, and `performance`'s effective weight was roughly
        double what the weight vector said. C12 called folding risk into performance
        backwards; the fix is to take performance back out of risk.

        What is left is genuinely orthogonal, measured on the same sample:

            corr(Δ minutes-weighted availability, performance)   0.136

        The score is the **change** in the availability of the minutes involved, not the
        level of the incoming package's. A level answers "are these players durable",
        which is not a question about the trade; the change answers "is the team taking on
        more games-missed exposure than it is shedding", which is. Availability is a share
        of games in 0..1, so the difference is bounded on [−1, 1] and maps affinely onto
        the full 0..100 scale — this component is not squashed, because both endpoints
        mean something.

        **Where a side is empty the baseline is the roster's own measured availability**,
        not an invented one: minutes not spent on an arriving player are spent by the
        players already there, and their weighted availability is a measurement this
        pipeline already makes. When even that is unmeasurable the component is withheld.

        `prob_positive` is not lost — it is still computed, still returned under
        `uncertainty`, and still drives the displayed interval. It is simply no longer
        scored a second time.
