"""Start from a need, not from a trade.

The trade evaluator answers "is this deal good?". A front office asks the question the
other way round — "we cannot shoot; who can we get, and what would it cost?" — and until
R6 this product had no path from a diagnosed weakness to a specific name.

The chain is: **diagnosis → need → candidates → fit → acquisition cost → a trade you can
evaluate.** Every link reuses a system that is already validated; nothing new is fitted.

## The ranking rule, stated

Candidates are **filtered** by the need and **ranked** by projected wins.

- *Filter*: the player's percentile in the skill that addresses the chosen need must
  exceed the acquiring roster's own strength in that skill. A player who does not improve
  the thing the team is short of is not a target for it, however good he is.
- *Rank*: the projected win change from adding him, from `EvaluationService._performance`
  — R3's calibrated conversion through R5.5's rotation allocator.

**Ranking on `fit` alone was rejected, and the reason is written into `_fit` already:**
`fit_score` normalises minutes within each side, so a package's size cancels and
"acquiring an 8-minute player who answers a need scores like acquiring a 32-minute one".
As a component of a trade score that is correct — `performance` carries magnitude — but as
an ordering of acquisition targets it would put a specialist who plays six minutes level
with a starter.

**A single combined score was also rejected.** Blending need improvement with projected
wins needs a weight, and nothing in this repository can fit one: there is no labelled
outcome for "was this a good target". Both numbers are returned per candidate, the sort
key is named in the response, and `sort=need` reorders by need improvement instead.

## Cost is reported, never folded into the ranking

Three costs, each from an existing module and each able to say "unavailable":

- **On-court value** the counterparty must get back, in the units `generate_candidates`
  already balances packages in — `Σ (minutes/240)·(TEI − replacement)` — converted to
  projected wins through the same fitted constants.
- **Salary matching**: the outgoing salary the CBA's expanded-TPE bands would require.
  `unavailable` wherever the target has no contract, which under the available data is
  most of the league.
- **How hard he is to pry loose**: his share of his own team's modelled minutes and his
  rank there. Reported, never scored — it is a fact about the counterparty, not a price.

And then a **suggested outgoing package** from the acquiring roster that balances the deal
inside `MAX_VALUE_GAP_WINS`, returned as a ready-to-evaluate trade payload so the chain
ends where the trade evaluator begins.

## Feasibility closes the loop, and it changes the answer

Ranking by projected wins alone produces the same list for everybody. Measured across the
30 ingested rosters, the unfiltered top five of all 30 teams contained **26 distinct
players**: the need decides *which* elite player, and then every team is told to trade for
him. That is not a target list, it is a leaderboard.

So each candidate is put through the trade evaluator with its suggested package, and kept
only if it clears the conditions `generate_candidates` already commits to — both sides
above the composite's own neutral point, neither projecting worse than
`MAX_PROJECTED_WIN_LOSS`, and not verified illegal. The constants are imported from that
module rather than restated, so the two features cannot disagree about what a front office
would accept. The budget, the rejection tally and the reason for each rejection are
reported, exactly as the generator reports its own.

`feasible_only=false` returns the unfiltered ranking, so the difference the filter makes is
inspectable rather than asserted.
