"""Player and roster intelligence: the read surface Pivot's decision workflow starts from.

The shipped product could already answer "what does this trade do?". It could not answer
the three questions that come *before* a trade, even though it held every number needed:

    what does this player actually do?          -> player_intelligence()
    what does our roster contain, and lack?     -> team_profile()
    would this player fit HERE?                 -> player_team_fit()

Nothing in this module computes a new basketball quantity. Every number it returns is
produced by machinery that already shipped and is already tested — `player_skill_vector`,
the deterministic archetype chain, the stored `team_needs` rows, and `EvaluationService._fit`
with its measured one-way baselines. What is new is that these are *addressable*: a caller
can ask about one player or one team without constructing a trade first.

Three properties this module is responsible for, none of which the underlying machinery
enforces on its own:

**Fit is conditional, and the type makes it so.** There is no `fit(player)`. The only entry
point is `player_team_fit(db, player_id, team_id)`, because Fit(X, A) != Fit(X, B) is the
product's position and a signature that permitted a universal score would undermine it in
the one place a reader looks first.

**A dimension Pivot cannot see is named, not omitted.** `player_intelligence` returns an
entry for every dimension in `domain.skills.DECLARED_DIMENSIONS`, and the ones with no
measurement carry `available: false` and the reason. A reader learns that Pivot cannot see
switchability rather than concluding that switchability does not matter.

**Strength and weakness are decided here, once.** The thresholds that turn a need row into
a headline used to be constants in the browser (`frontend/lib/needs.ts`), which made a
basketball judgement a presentation-layer decision no backend test could reach. They live
in `domain.needs` now and are applied here, so every client is served one answer.

        Modelled as an addition: the player arrives and nobody departs, so his minutes come
        out of the incumbents and are priced against the roster's own minutes-weighted
        skill profile — the measured one-way baseline R5.5 established, not a fabricated
        median player.

        The score is the shipped `fit` component on its documented 0..100 scale where
        **50 means "changes nothing"**, and it carries the same disclosures the trade
        evaluator shows: which needs were addressed, which skills were redundant, which
        could not be compared, and which measured needs no player skill claims to fix.

        **Withheld when the roster has no measured need.** `fit_score` is a needs term
        minus a redundancy term. When no need clears `NEED_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD` the needs
        term is close to zero for every candidate, the score becomes a pure redundancy
        penalty, and it then ranks *better* players lower — because a better player is
        strong in more skills and is charged for each one the roster already has.

        Measured on the 30 ingested rosters. Where the need vector has signal the score
        discriminates correctly:

            DEN (POA defense 1.00, rim protection 0.86)  n=127  median 63.9  sd 28.9
                best  Jalen Smith, Moussa Cisse, Charles Bassey   (rim protection)
                worst Payton Pritchard, Collin Sexton             (small guards)
            SAC (3P volume 1.00, efficiency 0.93)        n=129  median 62.3  sd 34.8
                best  Porzingis, Jokic, Tatum                     (shooting bigs)
            MEM (defensive rebounding 1.00)              n=129  median 49.7  sd 33.7
                best  Jokic, Gafford, Porzingis                   (rebounding bigs)

        Where it does not, it inverts:

                88.6 % below neutral; worst-ranked player is Donovan Mitchell

        Two of thirty rosters are in that state today. They get an explicit unavailable

    Pure, so the rule is testable without a database — and server-side, so every client
    gets the same answer. A weakness needs real severity; a strength needs severity
    *exactly* zero and a percentile above the bar. Nothing can satisfy both, which is the
    defect this shape exists to prevent: Atlanta once appeared under Strengths and Needs
    simultaneously for defensive rebounding, with a zero-length bar under a caption
    promising that a longer bar meant a larger shortfall (QA-9).

    The old fallback — "if nothing clears the threshold, show the top four by severity
    anyway" — is deliberately not reproduced. 135 of 279 stored rows have severity 0, so it
    presented teams with a weakness list they did not have.
