"""Query budgets for the two hot paths (R2a).

Measured on the live database at `f16dedc`, with `contracts` at **0 rows** — the
cheapest possible case, because a missing contract is one query that returns nothing:

    POST /trades/evaluate  (2-for-2)        61 queries
    POST /trades/generate  (focal BOS)   21,326 queries in 2.15 s

16,640 of those were the same `SELECT … FROM contracts WHERE player_id = ?` and 1,169
were `SELECT … FROM league_cap_parameters` for one immutable row. The plan measured
47,158 queries / 5.17 s with contract data loaded; on the compose Postgres path that is
7–14 s of pure round-trip latency, which is why the budget is expressed in *queries*
rather than seconds — SQLite hides the cost that matters.

These numbers are ceilings, not targets. They exist so a re-introduced N+1 fails a test
instead of being noticed in production.
