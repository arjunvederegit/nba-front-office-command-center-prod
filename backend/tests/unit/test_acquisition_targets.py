"""Properties of need-driven discovery.

The battery in `app/services/acquisition_validation.py` measures the live league; these
pin the rules that must hold on any league — including the two states that are answers
rather than failures: a need no player skill addresses, and a roster whose own level in a
skill is unknown.
