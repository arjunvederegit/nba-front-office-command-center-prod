"""The intelligence read surface.

These endpoints are new, but almost nothing they return is. The properties worth pinning
are therefore not "does the arithmetic work" — the underlying machinery has its own tests —
but the four claims this layer is responsible for:

1. A declared dimension Pivot cannot measure is **named with its reason**, not omitted.
2. A player with no impact estimate reports **no number**, not a zero.
3. Strength and weakness are decided **on the server**, from one threshold pair, and the
   two lists cannot overlap.
4. Fit is **conditional on a team**, and is **withheld** where the need vector cannot
   support it rather than served as a redundancy penalty that ranks stars last.
